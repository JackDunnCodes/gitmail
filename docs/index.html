    <h1><code>gitmail</code></h1>
    <p><code>gitmail</code> will be a service that allows you to have an email forwarder for your git commits, so that you don't permanently store your own email forever.</p>
    <p>It will (hopefully!) be free. I want to make a minimal sign-up process, but at the same time allow users to lock old emails that are being spammed.</p>
    <p>If you'd like updates, then follow along at <a href="https://github.com/JackDunnCodes/gitmail/">the <code>gitmail</code> repo</a> :)</p>
